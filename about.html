        <p>A public eating establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt. It
            served only one dish, a plate of cereal, wild fowl, and onions.[5]
            <br>

            A forerunner of the modern restaurant is the thermopolium, an establishment in Ancient Greece and Ancient
            Rome that sold and served ready-to-eat food and beverages. These establishments were somewhat similar in
            function to modern fast food restaurants. They were most often frequented by people who lacked private
            kitchens. In the Roman Empire they were popular among residents of insulae.[6]

            In Pompeii, 158 thermopolia with service counters have been identified throughout the town. They were
            concentrated along the main axis of the town and the public spaces where they were frequented by the
            locals.[7]
            <br>

            The Romans also had the popina, a wine bar which in addition to a variety of wines offered a limited
            selection of simple foods such as olives, bread, cheese, stews, sausage, and porridge. The popinae were
            known as places for the plebeians of the lower classes of Roman society to socialize. While some were
            confined to one standing room only,
            others had tables and stools and a few even had couches.[8][9]

            Another early forerunner of the restaurant was the inn.
            <br>Throughout the ancient world, inns were set up alongside roads to cater to people travelling between
            cities, offering lodging and food. Meals were typically served at a common table to guests. However, there
            were no menus or options to choose from.[10]

            The Arthashastra references establishments where prepared food was sold in ancient India. One regulation
            states that "those who trade in cooked rice, liquor, and flesh" are to live in the south of the city.
            Another states that superintendents of storehouses may give surpluses of bran and flour to "those who
            prepare cooked rice, and rice-cakes", while a regulation involving city superintendents references "sellers
            of cooked flesh and cooked rice".[11]
